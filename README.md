About Dataset

Dataset Summary: This dataset comprises 10,602 English text entries filtered by the label category “none.” It aims to facilitate research in detecting and analyzing sexism in language by providing examples of non-sexist text.

Key Features:

rewire_id: Unique identifier for each entry.
text: The English text for analysis.
label_sexist: Classification indicating whether the text is sexist (not sexist, 75.7%).
label_category: The category label, which is “none” in this filtered dataset (75.7%).
label_vector: Represents a vectorization of the text; currently marked as “none” (75.7%).
split: Indicates the dataset split; all entries belong to the training set (100%).
Usage: This dataset is valuable for researchers, developers, and organizations interested in developing models for sexism detection in textual data. It can be used to train machine learning algorithms to recognize patterns in non-sexist language and assess biases in text.
